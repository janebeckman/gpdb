Data in many Greenplum Database deployments may already reside in external sources. The PXF Extension Framework (PXF) provides access to this external data via built-in connectors called plug-ins. PXF plug-ins facilitate mapping an external data source to a Greenplum Database external table definition. PXF is installed with HDFS and Hive connectors, enabling you to access HDFS file system and Hive data in text, Avro, RCFile, Parquet, and ORC formats.
