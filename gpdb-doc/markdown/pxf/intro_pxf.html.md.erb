You can use the Greenplum Database PXF Extension Framework to access external data sources as though they were local to your Greenplum Database deployment. 

## <a id="intro_pxf_overview"></a>Overview

Data managed by your organization may already reside in external sources. The Greenplum Database PXF Extension Framework (PXF) provides you access to this external data via built-in connectors that map a Greenplum Database external table definition to an external data source. 

PXF is installed with HDFS and Hive connectors. These connectors enable you to read external HDFS file system and Hive data in text, Avro, RCFile, Parquet, and ORC formats.

The PXF Extension Framework is a Java service that runs on each Greenplum Database segment host.
