  <shortdesc>Greenplum Database provides standard command-line utilities for performing common
    monitoring and administration tasks. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Greenplum command-line utilities are located in the
        <filepath><varname>$GPHOME</varname>/bin</filepath> directory and are executed on the master
      host. Greenplum provides utilities for the following administration tasks:</p>
    <ul id="ul_mtm_tsv_fp">
      <li>Installing Greenplum Database on an array</li>
      <li>Initializing a Greenplum Database System</li>
      <li>Starting and stopping Greenplum Database</li>
      <li>Adding or removing a host</li>
      <li>Expanding the array and redistributing tables among new segments</li>
      <li>Managing recovery for failed segment instances</li>
      <li>Managing failover and recovery for a failed master instance</li>
      <li>Backing up and restoring a database (in parallel)</li>
      <li>Loading data in parallel</li>
      <li>Transferring data between Greenplum databases</li>
      <li>System state reporting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pivotal provides an optional system monitoring and management tool, Greenplum Command
      Center, which administrators can install and enable with Greenplum Database.
      Greenplum Command Center depends upon data collection agents on each segment host to
      collect and store system metrics in a dedicated database named
          <codeph>gpperfmon</codeph>. Segment data collection agents send their data to
      the Greenplum master at regular intervals (typically every 15 seconds). The data
      collection agents and the <codeph>gpperfmon_install</codeph> management utility,
      which creates the database and enables the agents, are included with Greenplum
      Database. Users can query the <codeph>gpperfmon</codeph> database to see query and
      system metrics. Greenplum Command Center has a graphical web-based user interface
      for viewing the system metrics, which administrators can install separately from
      Greenplum Database. For more information, see the <xref

          Command Center documentation</xref>.</p>
